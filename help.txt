Hello trainers!
I am professor Oak.
I can instantly tell the counter to any pokemon
And search entire discord for you!
You can use me for 2 things mainly:
```1. Search the best pokemon counter for any pokemon```
```2. Search different servers for raids and easily join them```
The upcoming pages introduce you to these concepts:
```
1. Searching the best pokemon counter.
2. Searching different servers for raids.
3. Setting up your server to search for raids.
4. Removing your server to search for raids.
5. Creating groups to organise your servers.
6. Adding your server to groups.
7. Joining the required server to do a raid.
```

you can search for these pages using /help {page}

It can be quite hard for you to instantly tell
which pokemon to use for which raid.
That is where I come in!
With one command you can instantly get the best
pokemon counters for any pokemon!
You can use `.raid meta {pokemon}` or `/raid meta {pokemon}`
replacing the {pokemon} with the pokemon's name.

An example would be:
```
.raid meta pikachu
/raid meta pikachu```

**Protip:** to specify that your pokemon is ev trained,
you can use --godtier after the pokemon's name.
like: `.raid meta pikachu --godtier`

I know how annoying it is to search for raids
during global times. That is where I come in!
Instantly search through hundreds of raids
by using my command:
```
/raid search
.raid Search
```
Do you know of some ~secret~ group code which allows access
to servers which the typical raid search command does not show?
you can type the group code after the command like:
```
/raid search {group}
.raid search {group}
```
Learn more about the group in `page 5`

My `/raid search` command works by checking 
every server I am in to see if there is a raid.
But not all the servers I am in like others to join
their raids. So by default I do not search for raids.
But if you want to contribute and help others also 
join raids, you can enable searching for raids 
in this server by using my commands:
```
/server make_public 
.server make_public
```
Optionally, you can also add this server 
directly to a group by specifying the group name
after the command like this:
```
/server make_public {group}
.server make_public {group}
```
Learn more about groups in `page 5`

**Note:** Professor Oak reads the messages in public
servers to find a raid. So making this server public
allows Professor Oak to read messages in this server.
None of the messages are stored.

To remove a server from raids, it is very easy.
You just have to type one command.

```
/server remove_public
.server remove_public
```
This also removes the server from any groups if it 
is a part of one.
Please do not hide a server as it helps others
find raids. Imagine if you do not find a raid
when you need one? Always try to help others.

#page#

Groups are a way to organise (and hide) your servers.
When you add a server to a group, it is not accessible
by just typing `/raid search`. But instead requires
a special name of the group to access it. like:
```
/raid search {group}
.raid search {group}
```

To make a group, all you have to do is 
```
/group new {group name}
.group new {group_name}
```
**Note** that only select people can create groups.
To get the permission to create groups, contact
`known_as_agent`.

#page#

There are two ways add a server to a group,
one is to add it when making the server public,
like:
```
/server make_public {group}
.server make_public {group}
```
or if you server is already public you can change
its group using:
```
/server change_group {group}
.server change_group {group}
```
To check the group your server is in,
you can use:
```
/server get_group
.server get_group
```

#page#
When you do raid search, 
you are presented with a list of raids from
different servers which show information 
like the raid stars, raid boss, time left
before the raid starts and the raid_id.

You can easily join the server the raid is going
on by using:
```
/server join {raid_id}
.server join {raid_id}
```
This creates an invite to that server
and sends it to you.
This invite is only temporary and you will be
removed from the server as soon you log out.

**Note:** the create_invites permission is required 
to make invites to the server. This is why Professor
Oak requires create_invites permission when adding it to a server.
